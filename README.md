## Abstract

 The permutation flow shop scheduling problem is one of the fundamental problems in scheduling with many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving it exactly. The algorithm uses an iterated local search to quickly find a good initial solution, followed by a cyclic best-first search with dynamic bi-directional branching to find the optimal solution and prove its optimality. In computational experiments we analyze the effects of the cyclic best-first search and the dynamic branching strategy, and show that our approach is able to combine preferable characteristics of the current best exact algorithms.
